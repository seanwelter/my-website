        <h2>Illahee State Park</h2>
        <p>A straight shot east down Sylvan Way, this national park is home to a beautiful hiking trail that winds down
            through forested hills and ravines until it culminates in a beautiful beachfront dock.</p>

        <h2>N.A.D. Park</h2>
        <p>Located along Kitsap Way just before it turns into Chico Way, this park straddles SR3, and has multiple
            different paths to take and get lost in. Watch out for stray frisbees, as part of the park is host to a
            frisbee golf course.</p>
