1.  I think the black text on the dark green background in the locations page is a little hard to read and could use more contrast.

For this one, I made the text on the location pages match the coloring of the text on my Home page; this also carries with it a bit of repetition.

2.  The location name for each location page is pretty far to the left, it feels like my eyes do an unnecessary amount of traveling.

For this one, I re-formatted the location names to match that of the Home page, again continuing a pattern of repetition.
