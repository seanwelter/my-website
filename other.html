            <h2>Elanden Gardens</h2>
            <p>You can still walk along the waterfront here, but the last time I went here it was closed to the public.
                You get a gorgeous view of the entire bay area though, so still worth the trip.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Poulsbo Waterfront</h2>
            <p>This place is a Viking experience nestled along the waters north of Silverdale. Try the bear claws!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Bainbridge Japanese Memorial</h2>
            <p>A bit of a drive, but well worth it, this is a memorial to all the Japanese people who were moved around
                during World War II to the internment camps. It's well cared for and offers an amazing view.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Keyport Waterfront</h2>
            <p>The last time I was here it was very hard to see anything due to all the rain and fog, but I have been
                told by many people that I missed out on a great vista at the very tip of Keyport.</p>
